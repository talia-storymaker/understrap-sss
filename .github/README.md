An [Understrap](https://understrap.com) child theme (based on the [starter child theme](https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child)) for my personal Superman-themed blog [Small Screen Superman](https://superman.nfshost.com/blog/).

Note that Small Screen Superman also has non-WordPress content, and that the SASS references some files that are contained outside of the WordPress files. Thus, if you try to use this theme yourself, a few things (such as images and fonts) won't work. I mainly have it on GitHub for reference rather than for this theme to be used by others, but if you are interested in this theme, feel free to contact me.
